## AI for E-Commerce Platform

This is a React-based e-commerce web application enhanced with **Smart NLP Search** to make finding products more natural and intuitive.  
Originally based on the [DredSoftLabs E-commerce Project](https://bitbucket.org/dredsoftlabs/ecommerce/src/main), this version adds AI-powered smart NLP search parsing to allow natural language queries like:
show me women clothing under $50
mens shoes above 100
electronics between 200 and 400
cheap jewelery with good reviews

## Features

  - Price detection:
    - `under 50` / `under $50` / `under $ 50`
    - `above 100` / `over $100`
    - `between 50 and 100`
  - Rating detection: `good reviews`, `4 stars and above`

## Bonus â€“ Blockchain Integration Idea
This AI search could be paired with blockchain features such as:

- Token-gated pricing: Discounts for holders of specific tokens.

- On-chain user preferences: Store product interest categories in a wallet for personalized recommendations.

- Loyalty smart contracts: Reward users with tokens for purchases made via AI-driven search results.
